# grafanalib examples
I have spent several days trying to figure out how to create dashboards and graphs in Grafana using the grafanalib Python module. The examples shown on the official documentation page is somewhat lacking in my opinion, so I have added some stuff to mine that you can use as an inspiration. One thing that is missing in the official documentation is alerts. I have added alerts in the examples in this repo.

You can find more info about the grafanalib module from their website: https://github.com/weaveworks/grafanalib

# Caveats
I have used grafanalib against AWS Managed Grafana (version 8). I have not tried these examples on other version of Grafana running on onprem or other cloud providers.

# Where?
In the file grafanalib-example.py I have commented on parts of the code that I think is important. Please also take a look at the official documentation page from the module homepage as well.
